"""The tables of a PDF, put back together from what its pages DRAW: ruling lines and positioned text.

A tender exported from Word draws its front table as a grid of ruling lines with the text of every cell placed
inside it - the number and the name centred in their cells, the content on as many lines as it takes. pypdf's
plain text of such a page is the rows read straight across:

    1.10.2 供应商提出问题
    的截止时间 /
    2.2.2 提交首次响应文
    件截止时间
    2028 年 6 月 12 日 9 时 30 分

which no rule about lines can take apart again: where the name ends and the content begins is not in the text.
It is on the page. The same pass of pypdf that yields the text yields every drawing operator, so

    document_texts(reader)   every page's text, each ruled table in it as "| 2.2.2 | 提交首次响应文件截止时间 | 2028 年 … |" rows
    page_text(page)          one page on its own (no knowledge of what repeats from page to page)

Running text stays exactly what pypdf gives (the pieces outside a table, in pypdf's own order and spacing).
Inside a table a cell's lines are joined the way a paragraph's are: a line that fills the cell runs on, a line
that stops short ends a paragraph of the cell ("；", the separator a Word cell's paragraphs get in
document_text.py). A cell spanning several rows is repeated in each of them, so every row reads whole.

Page furniture - a watermark, a running header, the page number - is text that stands at the same place on page
after page. It belongs to no cell and no sentence, and it is left out (a watermark drawn across the middle of
the page otherwise lands inside whatever cell lies under it).

Nothing is corrected or guessed: a page without a ruled grid of two columns or more comes back as plain text.
